This script is designed to process a CSV file containing product feature requests, create embeddings for each request using a pre-trained SentenceTransformer model, and store the embeddings and associated metadata in a vector database.
Here's a breakdown of the script:
1. Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries, including:
csv: for reading and processing the CSV file
SentenceTransformer: a library for creating text embeddings
vecs: a library for interacting with a vector database
flupy: a library for working with data in a functional programming style
tqdm: a library for displaying progress bars
typing: for type annotations
numpy: for numerical operations
2. Loading Environment Variables
The script loads environment variables using the dotenv library, specifically the DB_CONNECTION variable, which contains the connection string for the vector database.
3. Connecting to the Vector Database
The script creates a client for the vector database using the vecs.create_client() function and the DB_CONNECTION environment variable.
4. Creating a Vector Database Collection
The script creates or retrieves a collection named "product_requests" in the vector database, with a dimension of 384 (the size of the text embeddings).
5. Preprocessing the CSV Data
The script defines a preprocess_description() function that removes specific sentences from the product request descriptions. This is likely done to remove boilerplate or irrelevant text from the descriptions.
6. Reading the CSV File
The script reads the CSV file and extracts the request IDs and descriptions, storing them in a list of tuples called requests.
7. Creating Text Embeddings
The script initializes the SentenceTransformer model and processes the product request descriptions in batches. For each batch, it creates text embeddings using the model and stores the request ID, embedding, and the preprocessed description in a list of tuples called records.
8. Inserting Records into the Vector Database
The script iterates through the records list and inserts each record into the "product_requests" collection in the vector database using the product_requests.upsert() function.
9. Creating an Index
Finally, the script creates an index on the "product_requests" collection to optimize future queries.
Overall, this script is designed to take a CSV file of product feature requests, create text embeddings for each request, and store the embeddings and associated metadata in a vector database for later retrieval and analysis

VectorComparsion.py 
1. Importing Libraries
The script starts by importing the necessary libraries:
supabase: for interacting with the Supabase database
numpy: for numerical operations
pandas: for data manipulation and analysis
sklearn.metrics.pairwise: for calculating cosine similarity
ast: for converting strings to lists
os: for environment variables
dotenv: for loading environment variables
2. Connecting to Supabase
The script loads environment variables for the Supabase URL and key, then creates a Supabase client using these variables.
3. Fetching Data from Supabase
The script fetches all data from the new table in Supabase, selecting the id and vec columns. It stores the response data in the data variable.
4. Extracting IDs and Vectors
The script extracts the IDs and vectors from the fetched data.
5. Converting Vectors to Lists and Numpy Array
The script converts the vectors from strings to lists and then to a numpy array.
6. Calculating Cosine Similarity Matrix
The script calculates the cosine similarity matrix between the vectors using the cosine_similarity function from sklearn.metrics.pairwise.
7. Minimum Similarity Threshold
The script defines a minimum similarity threshold of 70% to filter the similar features.
8. Preparing Data for CSV
The script iterates through the IDs and calculates the similarity scores for each feature. It then finds the top 5 similar features for each feature, excluding self and applying the minimum similarity threshold. The script stores the results in a list called csv_data.
9. Creating DataFrame and Saving to CSV
The script creates a DataFrame from the csv_data list and saves it to a CSV file named full_similar_product_features.csv.
10. Output
The script prints a success message indicating that the CSV file has been created successfully.

CombineVectorToMetaData
1. Loading CSV Files
The script loads the two CSV files into Pandas DataFrames using the pd.read_csv() function. It specifies the file paths and the columns to read from the second file (sap_analytics_csv).
2. Handling Errors
The script handles potential errors that may occur during the loading process:
FileNotFoundError: If one or both of the CSV files are not found, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.
pd.errors.ParserError: If the CSV files cannot be parsed, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.
3. Merging DataFrames
The script merges the two DataFrames based on common columns:
full_similar_features is merged with sap_analytics on the Feature_ID column.
The result is then merged with sap_analytics again on the Similar_Feature_ID column.
4. Handling Errors
The script handles potential errors that may occur during the merging process:
KeyError: If one or more columns are not found in the CSV files, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.
5. Dropping Duplicate Rows
The script drops duplicate rows from the merged DataFrame based on the Feature_ID and Similar_Feature_ID columns. This ensures that each feature ID and similar feature ID combination appears only once in the output.
6. Handling Errors
The script handles potential errors that may occur during the dropping process:
ValueError: If the data cannot be processed, the script prints an error message and exits with a status code of 1.
7. Saving the Merged Data
The script saves the merged DataFrame to a new CSV file named merged_data.csv. It specifies the file path and the index=False parameter to exclude the DataFrame index from the output.
